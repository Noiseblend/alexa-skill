You can play any music blend by saying things like: play my morning blend, or, play some workout music.
You can also Ask Noiseblend to just play something, and let Noiseblend find the music you'll like.
If the music is not really what you'd like to hear, adjust your music by saying things like, add more acousticness, or, I need some groovy music.
You can also dislike artists and never hear from them again by saying, I don't like this artist.
For more information, read the skill description in the Alexa app.
